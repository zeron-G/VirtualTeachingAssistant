/**
 * `TeachingService` — the channel-agnostic request orchestrator.
 *
 * This is the one place the whole Virtual Teaching Assistant pipeline is tied
 * together. Every channel adapter (Discord now; email/web later) normalizes its
 * native event into an {@link InboundRequest}, hands it to {@link handle}, and
 * renders the returned {@link OutboundReply}. The service never knows which
 * channel a message came from.
 *
 * THE PIPELINE (fixed order, never reordered):
 *   1. Load the course config and build a {@link GovernanceContext}.
 *   2. INGRESS  — inspect the raw inbound text. A block short-circuits to a
 *                 refusal WITHOUT ever calling the agent.
 *   3. AGENT    — answer the PII-redacted question.
 *   4. EGRESS   — the MANDATORY last gate. The reply's text/status/citations
 *                 come from the {@link EgressDecision}, NEVER the raw agent text.
 *   5. AUDIT    — append exactly one durable record. Runs on EVERY terminal path
 *                 (ingress-block, success, AND error).
 *   6. Return the {@link OutboundReply}.
 *
 * CARDINAL INVARIANTS (all enforced here, all load-bearing):
 *   (a) Egress runs on the agent output before EVERY non-ingress-blocked reply,
 *       and the reply is built from the EgressDecision — never the raw agent text.
 *   (b) `audit.append` runs on every terminal path, INCLUDING unexpected errors.
 *   (c) The stored question/answer are the redacted / egress-scanned versions,
 *       honoring the `@vta/audit` redaction invariant.
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE: the entire body is wrapped in try/catch. Any unexpected throw is
 * converted to a neutral `error` reply AND a best-effort `error` audit entry, so
 * a thrown error can never deliver an ungoverned answer.
