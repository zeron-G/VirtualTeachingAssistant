/**
 * Minimal typed shapes for the Canvas LMS resources this package reads.
 *
 * These are deliberately PARTIAL: Canvas returns large, loosely-specified JSON
 * objects whose exact shape varies by instance version and feature flags. We
 * model only the fields the ingestion pipeline consumes, mark everything that
 * may legitimately be absent as optional, and never assume the presence of a
 * field we did not request.
 *
 * FERPA-aware design choices baked into these types:
 *   - There is NO type for quiz questions. Quiz questions are never fetched or
 *     indexed (a deliberate policy choice mirrored from the production system),
 *     so no shape exists to tempt a caller into reading them.
 *   - `CanvasEnrollment` is SANITIZED: it carries a user id, a display name, and
 *     a role ONLY. Student emails (and any other PII Canvas would otherwise
 *     return) are stripped at the client boundary and never modelled here.
 *
 * Field-shape uncertainty is flagged with `TODO(verify)` against the Canvas
 * REST API docs (https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/). Where a field's
 * exact union of values is unknown we keep it as `string`.
