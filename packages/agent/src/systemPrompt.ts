/**
 * The SOFT prompt layer for the course teaching-assistant agent.
 *
 * This prompt shapes behaviour (identity, grounding discipline, tone, what to
 * redirect) but it is NOT the security boundary. Governance is the HARD
 * backstop: the tool-gate decides what tools may run (inline, before every
 * execution) and the egress governor verifies grounding and content boundaries
 * before any answer is delivered. A prompt can be ignored by a model; the gates
 * cannot. Keep that division of labour in mind when editing this text.
